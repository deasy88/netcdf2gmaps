NetCDF2GMaps Project Documentation

1) A Command line tool was built:

The function of this Command line tool is: to take NetCDF file and run a program that generates
Image Overlays in Jpeg format

2) It was Generated an Json file that presents Image Overlay file list and the metadata

The Metadata that needs to be collected for each visualization looks like that on a json file:

{
    "imagesOverlays":[
        "http://s3dsfdfdf/1992.jpg",
        "http://s3dsfdfdf/1993.jpg",
        "http://s3dsfdfdf/1994.jpg",
        "http://s3dsfdfdf/1995.jpg",
        "http://s3dsfdfdf/1995_2.jpg"
    ],
    "description":"This is an example experiment",
    "author":"brasil@home",
    "more_info_url":"http://brasilathome.org",
    "bbox_minx":"-180",
    "bbox_miny":"-85",
    "bbox_maxx":"180",
    "bbox_maxy":"85"
}

3) A Flash application was built:

It goes to a visualization tool on the web and write the overlay URL

When you open the web browser, the default is to open an UI to enter the URL of the NetCDF2GMaps URL file.
Alternatively, the URL can be passed directly on the web browser

Then the Overlays+Json metadata file are uploaded to a web server

4) The Website describing the project is at xxx.xx.xxx.xx
